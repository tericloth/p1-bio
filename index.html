		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>I come from a small dusty agriculture town called Visalia California. I distinctly remember going with my high school friend in her Volkswagon Beetle on photojourneys with our small digital cameras. I developed a deep love of photography especially after my dad gave me his film camera and I decided to chase journalism as my career.</p>
		<p>

		I felt there was much more of the world to see and decided to move to Spokane Washington with a friend. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p>

		I was taken to a large fair by the Canadian border. It was a barter fair, and there I saw the craziest thing! A baton about a foot and a half long, with both ends on fire! It was spinning in a circular motion being tossed 20 feet into the air by someone holding two sticks and bouncing this baton between them.

		Many people talk of love at first sight with a person well I found love at first sight with firespinning. Now, six years later, I am part of a non-profit organization teaching circus arts to at-risk youth.</p>
